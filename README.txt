Steps on how to run the program: (I was using pycharm)
1- You will find three files:
   - extractor.py which has the main method and there is where the program should run
   - exporter.py which has the method generate_xml 
   - feed.xml which gets generated by the program (you can delete it as it will be generated after running the code again)
2- There is a directory db as well which contains the database schema.
Note: the first two records of the databse have incorrect written descriptions I think, it is not due to the program. Anyway, I kept the databse as it is.
